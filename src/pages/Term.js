                  <p>
                    Any disputes or claims arising out of or in connection with
                    these Terms or the use of the Sevenunique platform shall be
                    resolved in accordance with the substantive laws of India.
                  </p>
                  <h6>16.2 Jurisdiction</h6>
                  <p>You agree that:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      All disputes shall be subject to the **exclusive

                      **Jaipur, Rajasthan, India**.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      You irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of these courts
                      and waive any objection to the venue on the grounds of

                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    This clause does not prevent Sevenunique from seeking
                    injunctive relief or legal recourse in other jurisdictions
                    if required to protect its intellectual property, data, or

                    If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or
                    unenforceable under applicable law, that provision will be
                    enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the
                    remaining provisions shall continue in full force and
                    effect.
                  </p>
                  <h6>16.4 No Waiver</h6>
                  <p>
                    No failure or delay by Sevenunique in enforcing any
                    provision of these Terms shall be deemed a waiver of our
                    rights. Any waiver must be expressly stated in writing.

                  <p>
                    This legal clause ensures that the rights and remedies of
                    both parties are recognized under Indian legal authority and
                    subject to clear enforcement protocols.
