            Insurance is just like a safety cushion that people avail for themselves in times of emergency. The insurance policy serves as a legal contract between the insurer and you. Premium payments are one of the conditions you need to follow to get the benefits you are promised in the insurance policy. The date and the frequency of the insurance premium payment are determined at the time of policy purchase.
